# 2b2t MCPE
An actual clone of the MC:PC Anarchy Server, 2b2t (2Builders2Tools)

# But isn't there already one?
Yes there is, but it's P2W (Pay 2 Win). You can buy /fly and etc on it. It's not the way 2b2t is.

# What makes this one so different to the other 2b2t MCPE?
Well, it'll be exactly like MC:PC Server. 1000x1000 respawn radius. Commands that have the same output. Also, it won't have /tpa and /sethome. You have to travel using coords, just like the PC version.
